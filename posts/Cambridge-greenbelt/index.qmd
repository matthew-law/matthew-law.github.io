A map of Cambridge's greenbelt, mapped from one of the little rural enclaves with a view of said belt from my window.

**Data**: greenbelt via the (now former) [Department for Communities and Local Government INSPIRE OGC WFS Service](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/f7f5e3a4-05a6-41f0-bc66-a36df6708fe0/dept-for-communities-and-local-government-inspire-ogc-wfs-service), everything else from OS [Open Zoomstack](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-zoomstack). **Tools**: QGIS, making use of the ability to combine multiple symbologies (namely shapeburst, striped fill, and outline for the greenbelt itself).
