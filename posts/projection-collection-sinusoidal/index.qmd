My contribution to Daniel Huffman's [Projection Collection](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2022/06/07/projection-cards-now-a-reality/) project, a set of trading cards where card each is a different map projection.

The map itself is a [Sinusoidal Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal_projection), and was made in QGIS using the '1981' polygons from [Project Linework](https://www.projectlinework.org/). The style is supposed to be vaguely reminiscent of a monochrome green CRT monitor -- I think it was the combination of the projection's bulge and the word 'sinusoidal' which brought that aesthetic to mind when I made the map.

It was really nice to get to map alongside (in a sense) many cartographers whose work I really admire by contributing to the project.
