The map was made in QGIS with the 'Generate XYZ Tiles' tool and data from a few different sources:

-   Forests, woods, and orchards from OpenStreetMap

-   Street trees from the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/local-authority-maintained-trees)

-   Building outlines, roads, and place names from Ordnance Survey's [Open Zoomstack](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-zoomstack)

-   Greenspaces from Ordnance Survey's [Open Greenspace](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-greenspace)

The tree data also highlights the effect of the infamous tree ban in the London borough of Brent (shown below with a dotted outline):
