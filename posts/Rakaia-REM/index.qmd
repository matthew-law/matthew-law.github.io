A first attempt at making a relative elevation model in QGIS, [following excellent tutorials by Daniel Coe](https://dancoecarto.com/tutorials).

For those not in the know, a relative elevation model (REM) is basically a standard [DEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model), but normalised to the elevation of a river channel so the value of a given pixel gives the height of that point *above the height of the nearest part of the river channel*. Or so the theory goes -- the creation of an REM in practice is as much of an art as a science and you can get quite different results depending on how you go about creating the REM.

Made with [1m LiDAR-derived elevation data from Land Information New Zealand](https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/53588-canterbury-christchurch-and-selwyn-lidar-1m-dsm-2015/).

It's interesting seeing the extent to which this kind of elevation data can reveal hydrological patterns that there's no way of seeing when looking at aerial imagery:
