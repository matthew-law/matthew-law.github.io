A fairly simple 'map' showing the elevation of a section of the Ural Mountains, produced in R with the [`ggridges`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/) package.

This kind of plot is often called a 'joy plot' after the [album cover](https://web.archive.org/web/20150425154607/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/2015/02/18/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-divisions-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/) of Joy Division's *Unknown Pleasures*, which my map wholeheartedly rips off.

### The R code to produce the map is available [here](https://github.com/matthew-law/30DayMapChallenge2022/blob/main/lines/ridgeplot.R).

The elevation data comes from [AWS Terrain Tiles](https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/) and is accessed via `elevatr::get_elev_raster()`.
