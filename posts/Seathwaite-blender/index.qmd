Inspired by [Owen Powell's excellent Blender creations](https://owenpowell.wordpress.com/30-day-map-challenge-2020/) over the course of last year's challenge, I had a go using Blender for the first time, mapping the area around Seathwaite Tarn in the Lake District.

I used 1m DTMs from [DEFRA](https://environment.data.gov.uk/DefraDataDownload/) and [OS Open Zoomstack](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-zoomstack) for the water and forest features.
