For the 'monochrome' day of the #30DayMapChallenge I made a fairly simple univariate map: the number of pigs per thousand people, visualised with points: denser points = more pigs per capita. I got the data from [Eurostat](https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ef_lsk_gpig) (one of the mythical Brexit dividends is that since leaving the UE (and Eurostat) the UK is excluded from these kinds of map) via the [eurostat](https://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/) R package.

To link the point density to the pigs per person, I used the Expression String Builder in QGIS -- I played around with this for a bit to get a satisfactory spread of density

One of the surprises of the Challenge was that this map highlighted the Spanish region of Aragon as the pig capital of Europe -- I didn't give this fact much thought when making the map but it subsequently found its way to Aragonese Twitter, and so for a few days my replies were filled with Spanish comments on the map.
