    "section": "",
    "text": "This map started with armchair travelling in Google Maps. I’d noticed that roads in the southern part of the Canadian province of Ontario were arranged in grids, but that there were a number of misaligned grids throughout the region:\n\nTo define the area I looked at the different administrative boundaries (admin_level 5 and 6 in OSM) and from these picked the ones I thought delineated the ‘griddiest’ area (very scientific, I know). Initially I tried getting the data into QGIS with the QuickOSM plugin but found that because the features were quite large the query often timed out, so I switched to using overpass turbo. I only wanted the roads which actually formed the grids (I know nothing of Canadian geography or history but Wikipedia leads me to believe these may be concession roads): through trial and error I settled on including everything on OpenStreetMap tagged highway=motorway, highway=trunk, highway=primary, or highway=secondary within the area of interest.\nIt was fun trying to reverse-engineer a methodology to try to get the different grid areas from just the roads – the basic Python methodology ended up being:\n\nuse the roads and land outline to create enclosures (polygons bounded by roads/boundary of study area)\ncalculate the orientation of eacch of these enclosures (technically, the orientation of the longest axis of their binding rectangles) using Martin Fleischmann’s excellent momepy package, rounding these values to the nearest 5°\ndefine as ‘neighbours’ of each enclosure: all enclosures that border a given enclosure (ie its direct neighbours), all enclosures that border the enclosures that border a given enclosure (ie its neighbours’ neighbours), and all other enclosures within 15 km\nget the modal orientation value (the one calculated in step two) for each enclosure + its neighbours (as defined above)\n\nThe full Python code used to make the map is available in a Jupyter notebook here, albeit you’ll need to provide your own data to reproduce it. If you do get that far though, you can use the .explore() method in geopandas to interactively explore the data:\n\nAn interesting point of comparison is this figure from “The Land Surveys Of Ontario 1750–1980”, an article by Louis M. Sebert in a 1980 edition of the journal Cartographica (doi: 10.3138/X1G3-5822-25G2-027M) which gives a bit of insight into how the grids ended up this way:"

    "text": "Link to full dissertation\nAs part of the Geographic Data Science MSc I completed at the University of Liverpool, I wrote a dissertation, the catchily-named “Using Urban Morphology to Improve Housing Submarket Spatial Segmentation”.\nI typeset the dissertation in R Markdown, which meant I could easily export both pdf and website versions.\nIn broad terms, the dissertation applies machine learning techniques to open data in order to partition a city into areas with different urban morphology. All of that was implemented in Python, relying on the momepy (‘Morphological Measuring in Python’) library developed by Martin Fleischmann, who supervised the dissertation along with Dani-Arribas Bel.\n\nFull abstract\nWhenever geographic data are aggregated spatially, a decision must be made about the spatial unit into which individual data points are grouped. In analyses of the real estate market, properties are grouped in this way into housing submarkets: sections of the real estate market which share similar characteristics. Typically, existing spatial units (such as administrative neighbourhoods or districts) are used to represent these submarkets, however there is no guarantee that such units align with the housing market dynamics they seek to delineate. This dissertation presents a method to segment an urban area into different spatial units based on its built form – its urban morphology. The spatial segmentations produced are then assessed to determine whether they can be used to represent housing submarkets. Besides the novel segmentations themselves, the dissertation presents several methodological findings. Contextual characters and the transposition of cluster labels onto simpler geometries are shown to be key methods for ensuring spatially coherent segmentations. Segmentations are shown to significantly vary depending on the spatial units clustered to generate the segmentations (with regular grids performing significantly worse than units based on buildings), and on the clustering algorithm employed."

Immediately I questioned its accuracy: I live firmly within the ‘1’ zone, and while it is true that most of my local numbered roads begin with 1 I’m also a frequent driver on the local A428, A505, and A603, so surely the regions mapped can’t be accurate. Naturally, the only course of action was to map out this hypothesis myself, using data from Ordnance Survey’s Open Zoomstack. The answer is that the Wikipedia map is mostly accurate, although there is definitely some overlap:\n\nI used a symbology expression in QGIS to colour the roads by number:\n\n(I believe this is what the kids call a Hit Tweet)\n\n\n#30DayMapChallenge Day 2: LinesGreat British roads, coloured by their numbers pic.twitter.com/aT5Vp0W89a\n\n— Matthew Law (@Iawmatthew) November 2, 2021"

Or so the theory goes – the creation of an REM in practice is as much of an art as a science and you can get quite different results depending on how you go about creating the REM.\n\nMade with 1m LiDAR-derived elevation data from Land Information New Zealand.\nIt’s interesting seeing the extent to which this kind of elevation data can reveal hydrological patterns that there’s no way of seeing when looking at aerial imagery:\n\nOriginal tweet thread here:\n\n\nMy first attempt at making a relative elevation model in QGIS, following excellent tutorials by @geo_coe 📍 Rakaia River 🇳🇿 https://t.co/yWM9IqeROd pic.twitter.com/IiBtZ0MpmO\n\n— Matthew Law (@Iawmatthew) February 3, 2022"

I wanted to map somewhere with the right scale and mixture of vegetation coverage to nicely showcase the data, and Wollaton Park seemed to provide this.\nThe VOM does come with a prerendered hillshade layer, but I wanted to have a bit more control over this, so used the rayshader package in R to generate my own – R code to do so available here! This meant that I could choose my own angle for the shadows (meaning it wouldn’t look off when I rotated the map), and mix in a layer with subtle ambient lighting. The code includes a function to save the array that rayshader generates to a projected geotiff I could drag/drop into QGIS and have appear in the right place (harder than I thought it would have been, although I wouldn’t be surprised if I missed an easier way to achieve the same thing) so do steal that function if you ever need such a thing!\nThe contour lines were generated from a lidar composite DTM from Defra, and the rest of the data came from OpenStreetMap (I particularly like the individually mapped golf fairways and greens, although looking at it now I think the colours I chose are too subtle).\nEverything was put together in QGIS, using geometry generator expressions to smooth the contours and generate waterlines for the lake, label masks for the labelling of both of these, and lots of use of the different layer blending modes to combine the various vegetation colour/shadow layers."
