I'd noticed that roads in the southern part of the Canadian province of Ontario were arranged in grids, but that there were a number of misaligned grids throughout the region:\n\n![](images/Ontario-gmaps.jpeg)\n\nTo define the area I looked at the different administrative boundaries (`admin_level` 5 and 6 in OSM) and from these picked the ones I thought delineated the 'griddiest' area (very scientific, I know). Initially I tried getting the data into QGIS with the QuickOSM plugin but found that because the features were quite large the query often timed out, so I switched to using [overpass turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/). I only wanted the roads which actually formed the grids (I know nothing of Canadian geography or history but Wikipedia leads me to believe these may be [concession roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_road)): through trial and error I settled on including everything on OpenStreetMap tagged `highway=motorway`, `highway=trunk`, `highway=primary`, or `highway=secondary` within the area of interest.\n\nIt was fun trying to reverse-engineer a methodology to try to get the different grid areas from just the roads -- the basic Python methodology ended up being:\n\n-   use the roads and land outline to create enclosures (polygons bounded by roads/boundary of study area)\n-   calculate the orientation of eacch of these enclosures (technically, the orientation of the longest axis of their binding rectangles) using Martin Fleischmann's excellent [`momepy` package](http://docs.momepy.org/en/stable/index.html), rounding these values to the nearest 5Â°\n-   define as 'neighbours' of each enclosure: all enclosures that border a given enclosure (ie its direct neighbours), all enclosures that border the enclosures that border a given enclosure (ie its neighbours' neighbours), and all other enclosures within 15 km\n-   get the modal orientation value (the one calculated in step two) for each enclosure + its neighbours (as defined above)\n\nThe full Python code used to make the map is available in a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/matthew-law/30DayMapChallenge2021/blob/main/grids/grids.ipynb), albeit you'll need to provide your own data to reproduce it. If you do get that far though, you can use the `.explore()` method in `geopandas` to interactively explore the data:\n\n![](images/GDF.explore().jpeg)\n\nAn interesting point of comparison is this figure from \"The Land Surveys Of Ontario 1750--1980\", an article by Louis M.
